## Quick Example

```csharp
using Switchboard.Infrastructure;

var app = new SwitchboardApp();

// Create a new Connect instance
var callCenter = app.CreateCallCenter("MyCallCenter", "my-call-center");

// Add business hours
var businessHours = HoursOfOperation
    .Create("Business Hours")
    .WithTimeZone("America/New_York")
    .WithStandardBusinessHours()
    .Build(callCenter);

// Add queues
var salesQueue = Queue
    .Create("Sales")
    .SetDescription("Sales inquiries")
    .SetMaxContacts(50)
    .Build(callCenter, businessHours.HoursOfOperation.Name);

// Create a contact flow with IVR menu
Flow
    .Create("Main Menu")
    .SetType(FlowType.ContactFlow)
    .PlayPrompt("Welcome to our call center!")
    .GetCustomerInput("Press 1 for sales, 2 for support.")
    .OnDigit("1", sales => sales
        .PlayPrompt("Transferring to sales...")
        .TransferToQueue("Sales")
        .Disconnect())
    .OnDigit("2", support => support
        .PlayPrompt("Transferring to support...")
        .TransferToQueue("Support")
        .Disconnect())
    .Disconnect()
    .Build(callCenter);

app.Synth();
```

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package NickSoftware.Switchboard
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

## Why I Built This

### The Problem I Faced

I'm a software engineer, not a DevOps or cloud engineer. When I started working with Amazon Connect at my job, I struggled—**a lot**.

**The reality of traditional Amazon Connect development:**

- **Massive JSON templates** for flows and queues that are impossible to read or understand
- **Manual ARN replacement** every time you export/import a flow (copy, paste, find, replace... hope you didn't miss one)
- **Zero validation** until deployment—you only discover errors after pushing to AWS
- **No version control** that makes sense—diffing JSON files with generated IDs is useless
- **No collaboration**—how do you review a 2,000-line JSON blob?
- **Hidden bugs** that only surface in production when customers are calling

**The gap between teams was huge.** Different organizations had their own patterns and frameworks involving complex JSON templates. Every time someone exported a flow, they'd manually replace ARNs in massive JSON objects. Errors were inevitable.

### The Breaking Point

After multiple times I deployed a flow with a typo in the JSON config, then having to modify it in the console because working with the JSON directly was nearly impossible, then having to update the JSON with dynamic values and accidentally missing a variable, I knew there had to be a better way.

**I'm a developer. I wanted to write code.**

### The Solution: Code-First Contact Centers

With a code-first approach:

✅ **Code is readable and understandable**—flows look like actual logic, not configuration soup
✅ **Real collaboration**—code reviews, pull requests, team development
✅ **Self-documenting**—the code speaks for itself about what gets created
✅ **Fluent API**—IntelliSense guides you through every configuration option
✅ **Built on CDK**—you still have full power to customize when needed
✅ **Version control that works**—meaningful diffs, rollback capability, audit trail

### For Developers, By a Developer

Switchboard was built to solve **my** problems. Maybe you have the same ones:

- You prefer writing code over clicking through consoles
- You want type safety and IntelliSense support
- You believe infrastructure should be version-controlled
- You think bugs should be caught at compile-time, not runtime
- You need to collaborate with your team effectively

If this resonates with you, **Switchboard is for you.**
